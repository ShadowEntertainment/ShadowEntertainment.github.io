__the game will be released in Early Access. Why?__
We want to make the best we can for this game, so when we release it in the next 1/2 years we will keep __adding content!__

With this philosophy every bug that occurs will be able to be repaired. Also there will be a lot of Minor and Major updates.

### Story Sneak Peek
In this horror game you play as Mike – a farmer. One day he was transfering heavy bags of wheat. While he was walking trough the field he saw a homeless man limping around. When the man saw Mike he begged him for food. He replied he will give him food only if he carried his bags with wheat. The man said he will try his best, and on his first steps he dropped the bag and it fell on him. The man haven't eaten in days, so the bag's weight was more than his and he passed away. Mike just continued with his job and got to sleep.
    At around 2:00 PM he woke up and his whole home and farm was burning. He started to scream and tried to get out. He broke a window and jumped out of it. He was running and running. Everything around him was burning. 

*The game is work in progress - many things will change, including the story!*
